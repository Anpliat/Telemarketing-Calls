# Telemarketing Calls

### Scenario
The data relates to telemarketing phone calls to sell long-term deposits. Within a campaign, the agents make phone calls to a list of clients to sell the product (outbound) or, if meanwhile the client calls the contact-center for any other reason, he is asked to subscribe the product (inbound). Thus, the contact is either unsuccessful or successful.
This study considers real data collected from one of the retail bank, from May 2008 to June 2010, in a total of 39883 phone contacts. More than one contact with the same client was frequently required in order to determine whether the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no').

### Purpose
Investigate which factors contribute to a successful contact (i.e. the client subscribes to the product).


### Analysis Overview:
* Data preparation (handle missing values, group variables, normalization) 
* Bivariate Analysis (correlation coefficients, boxplots, contingency tables)
* Logistic Regression Model Selection:
  * Remove problematic values (coefficients with “NA” values, coefficients whose value and standard error is very “high”)
  * Hypothesis testing (Wald test, Goodness of fit test)
  * Variable Selection (Stepwise procedures, Multi-collinearity testing)
  * Model Interpretation
  * Assumptions of logistic regression
  * Conclusions and Discussions
